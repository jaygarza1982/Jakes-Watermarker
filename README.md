# Jakes-Watermarker
How to run and use: The runnable binary file is located in "/bin/Release/Watermarker.exe".
Upon opening the file you will be greeted with a window that needs only three inputs: A folder that contains the pictures
to be watermarked, a folder to save the watermarked photos, and finally, a watermark to place over the photos. The watermark
MUST have a transparent background or else it will cover your photos completely.
